The main function in this repository is the `seqClass.py`. 
This function allows us to determine whether the nucleotide sequence we have is a DNA, RNA, or neither.
It can also help us detemine if a specific motif is found in our sequence. 

I also created a `basepercent.py` function that allows to calculate the percent abundace of any nucleuotide in a nucleotide sequence.
